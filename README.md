# chocolate-pizza

This project is part of the Tech Educators Full Stack MERN Bootcamp. I used Pair Programming to work with a partner to try to recreate the desired page. We didn't quite finished, but published is how far we got in 2 hours.

## Problem Domain
Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: “OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it on my desk (well, in my inbox) in four hours. It doesn’t need to be perfect… it needs to be as close to perfect as you can get it in that time.”

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we’ve been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.
